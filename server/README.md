Run the Server
To run the server in development mode, use:

```npm run dev```

This will start the server with `ts-node`.

To build and run the production version:

```
npm run build
npm start
```

`npm run build` will compile TypeScript files to JavaScript.
`npm start` will run the compiled JavaScript files from the `dist` directory.
